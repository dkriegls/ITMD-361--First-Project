<h3>Interstellar (2014)</h3>
<p>
“No parent should see their own child die”. This movie is so sad! The ending when he knows his daughter is going to die by the time he gets back destroys me.

<h3>
Perks of Being a Wallflower(2012)</h3>

<p>
I read this book for the first time when i was in 10th grade and i loved it because it was the first time i related so much with a story's protagonist. Then i saw the film. Lets just say i cried puddles. The music is so good too!
